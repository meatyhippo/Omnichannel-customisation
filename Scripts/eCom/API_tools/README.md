# Support Tools

This are Support Tools that can be used to help the merchant with their business. Help them with cases that are
a lot of work when this had to be done by hand.

When you go to this [confluance page](https://confluence.atlightspeed.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=122652048) you can which tools we provide for the merchant. 

> Only use the tools when you feel comfortable with it. If you hesitate about some action please ASK! Don't run the code because the action with the API Tools can not be undone.
