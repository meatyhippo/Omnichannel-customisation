# Omnichannel-customisation
A collection of: templates, customisation and tweaks for Lightspeed omnichannel

<span>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This page is a collection of some retail/omnichannel enhancements that I created.
	They are divided into 3 categories:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Templates:</br>
	These are full templates you can copy into the customer's account.
	</li>
	<li>
	Additions:</br>
	These are one-off additions you can make in the customer's current template without having to replace it. These take some more effort from the support agents.
	</li>
	<li>
	General improvements</br>
	These are general tweaks/enhancements that are mostly meant for the support agents, like chrome bookmarklets, TextExpanders... (not unlike the <a href="https://confluence.atlightspeed.net/display/eCom/Action+Bookmarks">eCom action bookmarks)</a>
	</li>
</ul>
	<p>Instructions on how to implement all the different types are below.
Below these instructions are tables that contain the info and links per topic. (also a ranking from beginner - intermediate - advanced)</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<h4>Templates:</h4>
<p>If the correct template does not exist in settings > print templates, create a new template and copy the raw github contents. Otherwise, with permission, copy the raw github file into the existing template by replacing it.</p>

<h4>Additions:</h4>
<p>Instructions to add the different lines are different depending on the functions.
They are provided in the comments of the github page.</p>
